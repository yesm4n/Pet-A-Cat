# Pet-A-Cat

I'm not focusing too much on desing. Basically trying to learn / practice all the skills I'm getting. 
Learning DOM manipulation, Javascrit implementation is my #1 priority. After this I'll return back to design area, learn how to create better
looking websites and so on (on top of that interactive). I hope!
